"""Target-address policy for the check engine (SSRF guard).

The same checkers run in two places:

* on a **remote outpost agent**, deployed *inside* a customer's network to
  monitor local and internal hosts - reaching loopback / RFC1918 there is the
  whole point, and
* in the **central Danbyte server**, where a tenant-defined check target that
  points at ``127.0.0.1`` or an RFC1918 neighbour is an SSRF vector: the check
  result (status code, body-regex match) is an oracle onto internal services.

So the policy can't be hard-coded. This module keeps a process-wide policy that
**defaults to permissive** (the outpost's needs, and backward-compatible for
existing agents that never call :func:`configure`). The central process opts
into a stricter policy at startup via :func:`configure` - see
``monitoring/apps.py``.

The cloud-metadata endpoint (link-local ``169.254.0.0/16`` / ``fe80::/10``) and
the unspecified address are **always** refused: they are never a legitimate
monitoring target anywhere, and metadata is the top SSRF prize on a cloud host.
